To get started, follow these steps to clone the repository and set up the necessary environment variables:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bashgit clone <repository_url>```

2. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project.

3. Add the following required variables to the .env file:


POSTGRES_URL=<your_postgres_server_url>
SESSION_TOKEN_KEY=<session_cookie_name>
SERVER_URL=localhost # Set to "localhost" for development, or the production server's index domain.
Environment Variables
POSTGRES_URL: This variable should contain the URL that points to your PostgreSQL server. Make sure to replace <your_postgres_server_url> with the appropriate database connection URL.

SESSION_TOKEN_KEY: Specify the name that you want your session cookies to have. Choose a unique and meaningful name for this variable.

SERVER_URL: In a development environment, set this variable to "localhost." For production, it should point to the index domain of the server running your application.
